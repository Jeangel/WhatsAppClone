- [x] Managing contacts, a contact is composed by an alias (not used yet! ðŸ˜­) and a phone number.
- [x] Chat list
- [x] Chat screen with basic text messages (_For now it just support 1 to 1 chats_)
- [ ] Add emoji picker to the message toolbar
- [ ] Add ability to send images
- [ ] Add presence events to the users I have an active chat with.
- [ ] Add ability to archive a chat
- [ ] Add message status (sent / viewed)
